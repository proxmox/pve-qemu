Subject: [PATCH] block/copy-before-write: use uint64_t for timeout in
 nanoseconds

rather than the uint32_t for which the maximum is slightly more than 4
seconds and larger values would overflow. The QAPI interface allows
specifying the number of seconds, so only values 0 to 4 are safe right
now, other values lead to a much lower timeout than a user expects.

The block_copy() call where this is used already takes a uint64_t for
the timeout, so no change required there.

Fixes: 6db7fd1ca9 ("block/copy-before-write: implement cbw-timeout option")
