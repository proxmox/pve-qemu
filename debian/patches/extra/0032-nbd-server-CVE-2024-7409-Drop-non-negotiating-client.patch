Subject: [PATCH] nbd/server: CVE-2024-7409: Drop non-negotiating clients
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

A client that opens a socket but does not negotiate is merely hogging
qemu's resources (an open fd and a small amount of memory); and a
malicious client that can access the port where NBD is listening can
attempt a denial of service attack by intentionally opening and
abandoning lots of unfinished connections.  The previous patch put a
default bound on the number of such ongoing connections, but once that
limit is hit, no more clients can connect (including legitimate ones).
The solution is to insist that clients complete handshake within a
reasonable time limit, defaulting to 10 seconds.  A client that has
not successfully completed NBD_OPT_GO by then (including the case of
where the client didn't know TLS credentials to even reach the point
of NBD_OPT_GO) is wasting our time and does not deserve to stay
connected.  Later patches will allow fine-tuning the limit away from
the default value (including disabling it for doing integration
testing of the handshake process itself).

Note that this patch in isolation actually makes it more likely to see
qemu SEGV after nbd-server-stop, as any client socket still connected
when the server shuts down will now be closed after 10 seconds rather
than at the client's whims.  That will be addressed in the next patch.

For a demo of this patch in action:
$ qemu-nbd -f raw -r -t -e 10 file &
$ nbdsh --opt-mode -c '
H = list()
for i in range(20):
  print(i)
  H.insert(i, nbd.NBD())
  H[i].set_opt_mode(True)
  H[i].connect_uri("nbd://localhost")
'
$ kill $!

where later connections get to start progressing once earlier ones are
forcefully dropped for taking too long, rather than hanging.
