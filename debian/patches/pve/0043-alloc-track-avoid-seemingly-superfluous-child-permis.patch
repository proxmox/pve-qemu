Subject: [PATCH] alloc-track: avoid seemingly superfluous child permission
 update

Doesn't seem necessary nowadays (maybe after commit "alloc-track: fix
deadlock during drop" where the dropping is not rescheduled and delayed
anymore or some upstream change). Should there really be some issue,
instead of having a drop state, this could also be just based off the
fact whether there is still a backing child.

Dumping the cumulative (shared) permissions for the BDS with a debug
print yields the same values after this patch and with QEMU 8.1,
namely 3 and 5.
