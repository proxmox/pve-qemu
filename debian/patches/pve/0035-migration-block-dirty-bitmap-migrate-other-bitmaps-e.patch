Subject: [PATCH] migration/block-dirty-bitmap: migrate other bitmaps even if
 one fails

If the checks in bdrv_dirty_bitmap_check fail, that only means that this
one specific bitmap cannot be migrated. That is not an error condition
for any other bitmaps on the same block device.

Fixes dirty-bitmap migration with sync=bitmap, as the bitmaps used for
that are obviously marked as "busy", which would cause none at all to be
transferred.
