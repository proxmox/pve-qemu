Subject: [PATCH] PVE backup: add fleecing option

When a fleecing option is given, it is expected that each device has
a corresponding "-fleecing" block device already attached, except for
EFI disk and TPM state, where fleecing is never used.

The following graph was adapted from [0] which also contains more
details about fleecing.

[guest]
   |
   | root
   v                 file
[copy-before-write]<------[snapshot-access]
   |           |
   | file      | target
   v           v
[source] [fleecing]

For fleecing, a copy-before-write filter is inserted on top of the
source node, as well as a snapshot-access node pointing to the filter
node which allows to read the consistent state of the image at the
time it was inserted. New guest writes are passed through the
copy-before-write filter which will first copy over old data to the
fleecing image in case that old data is still needed by the
snapshot-access node.

The backup process will sequentially read from the snapshot access,
which has a bitmap and knows whether to read from the original image
or the fleecing image to get the "snapshot" state, i.e. data from the
source image at the time when the copy-before-write filter was
inserted. After reading, the copied sections are discarded from the
fleecing image to reduce space usage.

All of this can be restricted by an initial dirty bitmap to parts of
the source image that are required for an incremental backup.

For discard to work, it is necessary that the fleecing image does not
have a larger cluster size than the backup job granularity. Since
querying that size does not always work, e.g. for RBD with krbd, the
cluster size will not be reported, a minimum of 4 MiB is used. A job
with PBS target already has at least this granularity, so it's just
relevant for other targets. I.e. edge cases where this minimum is not
enough should be very rare in practice. If ever necessary in the
future, can still add a passed-in value for the backup QMP command to
override.

Additionally, the cbw-timeout and on-cbw-error=break-snapshot options
are set when installing the copy-before-write filter and
snapshot-access. When an error or timeout occurs, the problematic (and
each further) snapshot operation will fail and thus cancel the backup
instead of breaking the guest write.

Note that job_id cannot be inferred from the snapshot-access bs because
it has no parent, so just pass the one from the original bs.
